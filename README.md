# **LeetCode Journey 🚀**

## **Introduction 📌**
Welcome to my LeetCode journey! I'm **Rishi Srivastava**, a passionate problem solver and aspiring software developer. I primarily solve problems in **C++**, focusing on **Data Structures and Algorithms (DSA)** to sharpen my skills and improve problem-solving efficiency.

I've been consistently solving **a problem a day**, aiming for continuous improvement and mastery in DSA. This repository serves as a tracker for my progress and a reference for anyone looking for structured practice.

## **🚀 Consistency & Motivation**
- **Consistency is the key!** I have been solving problems regularly to stay sharp and confident in coding challenges.  
- **Growth over time.** With each problem, I learn new patterns, approaches, and optimization techniques.  
- **Challenges push us forward.** No matter how tough a problem seems, breaking it down and understanding its core logic leads to improvement.  
- **Goal:** To continuously refine my problem-solving ability and prepare for coding interviews.  

💡 *“The best way to get better at problem-solving is to keep solving problems!”*
