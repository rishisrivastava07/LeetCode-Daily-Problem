## **LeetCode Journey 🚀**

### **Introduction 📌**
Welcome to my LeetCode journey! I'm **Rishi Srivastava**, a passionate problem solver and aspiring software developer. This repository tracks my **Problem of the Day (POTD)** solutions, **LeetCode Contests**, and **Data Structures & Algorithms (DSA) notes**.

This modular structure allows easy navigation across different aspects of my problem-solving journey. You can explore:

- 📆 **[Problem of the Day (POTD)](https://github.com/rishisrivastava07/Leetcode-Solving/tree/main/problem-of-the-day)**
- 🏆 **[LeetCode Contests](https://github.com/rishisrivastava07/Leetcode-Solving/tree/main/contest)**
- 📚 **[DSA Notes](https://github.com/rishisrivastava07/Leetcode-Solving/tree/main/data-structures)**

## **🚀 Consistency & Motivation**
- **Consistency is key!** I solve problems regularly to stay sharp and confident in coding challenges.
- **Growth over time.** Each problem helps me learn new patterns, approaches, and optimization techniques.
- **Challenges push us forward.** No matter how tough a problem seems, breaking it down leads to improvement.
- **Goal:** To continuously refine my problem-solving ability and prepare for coding interviews.

💡 *“The best way to get better at problem-solving is to keep solving problems!”*
